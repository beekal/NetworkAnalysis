Practical Applications : Is used extensively in wide range of applications and disciplines. For example, businesses use  SNA to support activites such as customer interaction and analysis, marketing and for varios business intelligence needs. It is also used in intelligence, counter intelligence and law enforcement activities to map a clandestine or covert organisation such as espionage ring, or a organised crime or a street gang.

The NSA is reported to have actively used it in clandestine mass electronic surveillance programs to generate data needed to perform SNA analysis on terrorist cells and other related networks. The analysis is performed to determine the leaders within the network which allows the military or other law enforcement assets to launch a captur or kill attacks on the high value targets  in leadership positions to disrupt the function of the network.[1]
